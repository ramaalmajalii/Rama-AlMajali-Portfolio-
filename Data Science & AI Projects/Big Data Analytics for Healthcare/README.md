- Analyzed scenarios such as:
  - Most requested tests
  - Demand trends over time
  - Peak days/hours and seasonal patterns
  - Test bundling patterns & emerging health concerns
- Applied **statistical models** (regression, classification, forecasting) and visualized results using **Power BI / Matplotlib**

## Big Data & Tools
- **Apache Spark** for large-scale data processing & aggregation  
- **Hadoop MapReduce** (e.g., word count for test names / positive vs negative counts)  
- **Power BI / Matplotlib** for dashboards & visual summaries
