# Prime Numbers & Image Processing in C

Small C project from my **Fundamentals of Computing** course (HTU, Fall 2022/2023).

The program includes:
- Checking if a number is prime
- Printing all primes in a range
- Generating primes using the **Sieve of Eratosthenes**
- Flipping a grayscale image vertically
- Rotating a grayscale image 90° clockwise
- Reading/writing image data from/to files
